# Text Classification using NLP

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify text data into categories such as sentiment or topics.

## Dataset

The dataset contains labeled text samples for classification tasks, such as positive/negative sentiment or multiple topic labels.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python 3.x  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- NLTK  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**  
   Load the text dataset and explore basic statistics and label distributions.

2. **Text Preprocessing**  
   Perform tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization, and vectorization using TF-IDF.

3. **Model Training**  
   Train classification models such as Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. **Visualization**  
   Visualize word clouds, feature importance, and performance metrics.

## How to Run
